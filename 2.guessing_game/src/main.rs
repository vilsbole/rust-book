// QUESTION:
// - What is the difference between variable binding and assignment?
//   ANSWER: Variable binding is the process of associating a name with a value.
//           Assignment is the process of giving a variable a value.
// - What is the difference between a method and an associated function?
//   ANSWER: Associated functions are functions associated with a type.
//           Methods are functions associated with an instance of a type.

// LEARN:
// 1. enum stands for enumeration !
// 2. each state of an enum is called a variant
// eg. Result is an enum with variants Ok and Err.
// 3. There is a difference between a library crate and a binary crate.
//    A library crate cannot be executed on its own.
//    A binary crate is a crate that can be compiled into an executable.
